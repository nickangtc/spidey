## User Stories
* Example. As a user, I want to save a story I'm reading, because I found it useful.
  * Given that I'm reading a story, when I tap the icon to save a story, then save it to my 'Saved Stories'.
* As an unregistered user, I want to have a straightforward process to sign up, because I hate configuration as an internet user.
  * Given that I'm on the site for the first time, when I click 'sign up', I should be done signing up within 2 clicks and be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard.
* As a user, I want to see multiple search results in a single window, because it helps me save time when fact-checking and simple researching.
  * Given that I've just loaded the site, when I write a search term in the field and hit enter, show me snippets of search results within the same window.
* As a user, I will click on snippets that resemble what I'm looking for to read the detailed article, because I'm looking for additional facts for my article.
  * Given that the snippets are already loaded on page, when I click on a snippet, bring up a large Modal with the content of the original article.
